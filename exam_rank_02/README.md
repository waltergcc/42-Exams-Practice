# Exam Rank 02

In this folder you will find my resolutions for the exercises that I have been doing to prepare for the Exam Rank 02. I have used the [grademe](https://grademe.fr/) plataform to prepare myself. 

## My advices to study
### 1. Don't worry about Norminette
- Norminette is not verified during the exam. Therefore, don't waste time on this during your practice.

### 2. Use VS Code
- It's easier to create the folder and files. I copy the name of `assignment` and paste in VS Code to create the folder and file.c. We can use VS Code during the exam.

### 3. Use the diff command
- When you have a specific text output exercises, create in the `Assignment` folder two files, one with the expected output and one with the output of your program. Copy and paste the expected outputs on one of the files, and the other, when the program is working, paste the outputs of your program. Then use the `diff` command to compare the two files. Example:
```shell
diff exam.txt my_out.txt
```
If there is no difference, the command returns nothing. If it has a difference, the command returns the line that is different. It is easier to find the error and correct before doing the grademe.

### 4. Explore the grademe
- During the study time do the exercises in the Order of the Grademe. At the end of the four levels, do them again until you complete all the exercises.
- If an exercise appears like any that you have done, find in `Success' folder the structure of the exercise already done, copy and paste it in your current exercise and make the necessary changes.This saves time and give you the chance to do more different exercises.
- After completing all 49 grademe exercises, delete everything from the Success folder and start again. 

Good study! :smile:
