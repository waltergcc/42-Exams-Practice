# Exam Rank 03

In this folder you will find my resolutions for the exercises that I have been doing to prepare for the Exam Rank 03. I have used the [grademe](https://grademe.fr/) plataform to prepare myself. 

This `ft_printf` resolution was used by me during the Exam and passed with 100%.

This `get_next_line` resolution which I used to study for the Exam was tested by a colleague during his Exam and also passed with 100%.

Good study! :smile:
