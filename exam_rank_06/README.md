# Exam Rank 06

In this folder you will find my resolutions for the exercises that I have been doing to prepare for the Exam Rank 06. I have used the [grademe](https://grademe.fr/) plataform to prepare myself.

This `mini_serv` resolution was used by me during the Exam and passed with 100%.

**Note¹:** I preferred not to use dynamic memory allocation to allocate the reading and writing buffer. Instead, I used a very large static buffer and everything went well.

**Note²:** During the exam we are given a file called `main.c` which contains an example of how it should work, but isn't a solution for the exam. This file can be used as a reference if you have any doubt. During training at `grademe` this file is also available along with Subject.

Good study! :smile:
